# Analyze AB test results
This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd002/dashboard/overview) certification.

## Overview
The project conducted A/B testing of user conversions on an old and new wepage.

## Steps to prepare data for testing:
- included handling mismatched condition and page assignment
- removing duplicate ids
- removing null rows if present
- datatype of all the columns

## Statistical Analysis
- Bootstrapping sampling distributions and p-value calculations
- hypothesis testing via bootstrapping
- Z-core tests
- Logistic regression
- Multiple linear regression modelling to assess for interactions of independent variables

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- StatsModels
- Scipy
- LaTex
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings
- The conversion rate for the new page was not superior to that for the old page
- The country of the user did not impact the rate of conversion between the new and the old page
- The timestamp did not impact the rate of conversion between the new and the old page
